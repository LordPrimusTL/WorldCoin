                <p>Pecuniah is a Peer2peer financial aid community born out of determination to level the ground for
                    everyone financially.</p>

                <p>We're a group of individuals that realized that the times we're right now, financial aid peer2peer
                    community can help a lot of us realize our dreams be it in getting material things or creating/enhancing
                    businesses from the returns. However, we may like to see it, crowdfunding is so powerful that it can
                    change our lives and that of the people around us positively if well harnessed.</p>

                <p>However, while the power of crowdfunding is evident, greed and selfish interests of humans kill most
                    Financial Aid peer2peer communities so quick even before attaining the lowest height of their purposes.
                    We've analyzed this trend and put rules and implementations that enforces the growth of Pecuniah and
                    reduces excesses at all times.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center big-text">Ideology</h2>

                <p>We believe in giving with the interest of the commmunity at heart. When you give without greed, you
                    unequivocally open ways for you to receive more. When you receive and spread the good news about
                    Pecuniah, you make the community sustainable for yourself and others. The more you put the interest of
                    the communnity before yours, the more you reap positively from the community and the projections of your
                    spare money becomes realistic and reliable. That is when you can say "If I put my spare money of &#8358;
                    10,000 and its returns into the community for 8 weeks I would get &#8358;246289.0625 in returns".</p>
